        <p>
        A brief overview of a pairs trade follows.
        Pairs arbitrage is a mean reversion strategy trading two or more securities:
        * with co-integrated prices, and
        * that have temporarily diverged.
        The strategy involves
        buying one security whilst simultaneously shorting the other security when the price differential is outside
        a given measure. On price convergence both positions are closed at profit.
        Of course, the prices may never re-converge, for example if there is change in the securities' fundamentals
        or the macroeconomic environment.
        </p>

        <p>
        Pairs trading opportunities are relatively rare, hence the development of this tool to enable daily observation
        of potential trends.
